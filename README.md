# KillCounter
A Plugin for PocketMine-MP, aiming to give a better and more fun PvP experience.
<br><br>
Another plugin that keeps track of kills?! There are already plenty! Why would I choose this plugin above other plugins like KillRate, that provider me with the same kind of features?

### Features
KillCounter has a more advanced kill tracking system than other kill tracking plugins on several points.
- [x] Kill tracking when the actual damage cause was not a player, but something else, using the last player attacker.
- [x] Lots of configuration allowing you to modify the plugin in whichever way you want, such as point amounts.
- [x] Economy support, requiring the Economizer library by @Chris-Prime.
- [x] Killing sprees, which will give you increasingly higher points for each kills, and shut downs.
- [x] Assists feature, giving points to every player that assisted in killing a player.
- [x] Custom PvP achievements, which can be created in the configuration.

... I'm convinced. How do I download this?

### Installation
It is mostly recommended to use released versions of the plugin, which can be found in the released version on Poggit. (once there is one)<br>
If you do decide you want the latest version of the plugin, it is recommended you fetch a pre-compiled phar file from Poggit-CI, which can be found below.
